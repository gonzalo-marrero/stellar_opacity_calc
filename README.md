👥 Authorship and Collaboration
This project corresponds to a collaborative code development carried out by:

Gonzalo Marrero Ramallo
Fernando Barnés Sánchez

The code implementation, analysis, and interpretation of results were performed jointly as part of an academic project.

📌 Objective:
Calculation of the total opacity in stellar atmospheres for two models:

Solar-type (T = 5000 K)

Hot model (T = 8000 K)

Python is used, assuming LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), to compute the populations of the different ionization and excitation states using the Saha equation. From these populations, the opacities are determined. The atmospheric model considers hydrogen only.

📊 Results:
The calculations are presented in tables and plots, showing the dependence of opacity on temperature and density.

🛠 Tools and Libraries:
Python 3.x, NumPy, SciPy, Astropy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
